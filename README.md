'Buzzfeed style' quiz (Disclaimer: I do not nor have I ever represented buzzfeed, this is simply a genre description)

Currently under development.

This quiz will represent the "What _____ are you?" buzz style quizzes inundating the world courtesy of buzzfeed. 
There are no 'correct' or 'incorrect' answers, rather each answer adds to the previous to create a weighted
answer.

The way these answers are represented in the quiz is through a number system. There are n^m results, where
n = number of answer options for each question
m = number of questions

Thus if you have a 5 question quiz with 2 answers ('Do you prefer milk or dark chocolate?'), you have 2^5=32 results.
Results are represented by number strings, as such:
00000
00001
00010...
...
11111

I hope you enjoy :)
